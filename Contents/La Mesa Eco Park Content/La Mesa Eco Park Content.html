        <br>
        <br>
        Long before it was established, La Mesa Ecopark was part of the 2,700-hectare La Mesa Watershed, which was the primary source of drinking water for Metro Manila residents, with 2,000 hectares of which are forested land. The 33-hectare public park located outside the natural boundaries of the watershed was rehabilitated in 1999. This area was named separately as La Mesa Ecopark and reopened to the public in 2004. Today, the eco-park is a destination for outdoor recreation and a true forest experience. It has blossomed into a well-preserved urban park, offering a wide range of activities and attractions for both locals and tourists, including swimming, biking, hiking, boating, fishing, and picnic areas. The park also offers educational programs and has an eco-museum and visitor center to raise awareness about environmental conservation.
