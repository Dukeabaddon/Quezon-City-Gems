        <br>
        <br>
        The University of the Philippines was established in 1908 by Act No. 1870 of the Philippine Legislature to “give advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences and arts, and to give professional and technical training to every qualified student regardless of age, sex, nationality, religious belief and political affiliation.” Initially, UP had three colleges: the College of Fine Arts, the College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Medicine and Surgery in Manila. As the student population continued to increase, the need for more buildings and academic units became apparent. In 1939, the Board of Regents acquired 493-hectares of land in Diliman, Quezon City. Construction began in the same year but the development of the area was stalled by World War II. The university administration led by UP President Bienvenido Gonzales sought a P13 million-grant from the US-Philippines War Damage Commission to restore the damaged facilities.
