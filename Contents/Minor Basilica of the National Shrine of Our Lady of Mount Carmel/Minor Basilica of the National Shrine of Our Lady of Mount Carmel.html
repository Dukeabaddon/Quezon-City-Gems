        <strong style="color: black;">History:</strong>
        The Minor Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, commonly known as the Carmelite Church or simply the Mount Carmel Church, is a significant religious landmark in the Philippines. Located in New Manila, Quezon City, the church was established in 1954 to honor the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The history of the church is deeply intertwined with the arrival of the Carmelite friars in the Philippines in the early 20th century. The present church, built in a Gothic architectural style, was consecrated in 1958. In 1988, it was granted the status of a National Shrine by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, and later, in 2018, Pope Francis elevated it to the rank of a Minor Basilica. Over the years, the Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Mount Carmel has become a center of Marian devotion and continues to attract pilgrims and worshippers, which contributes to its significance as both a spiritual and cultural heritage site in the Philippines.
