The coliseum quickly became a cultural and entertainment hub, hosting a diverse range of events, from sporting competitions and concerts to political rallies and religious gatherings. It gained international acclaim as the venue for the "Thrilla in Manila," the historic 1975 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.

With a seating capacity that can accommodate tens of thousands, the Smart Araneta Coliseum remains a vital part of the Philippines' cultural and entertainment landscape, hosting major concerts, sporting events, and other significant gatherings.
