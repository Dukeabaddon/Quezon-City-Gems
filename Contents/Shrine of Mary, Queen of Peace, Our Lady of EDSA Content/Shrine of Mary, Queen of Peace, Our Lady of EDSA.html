        <br>
        The EDSA Shrine, formally known as the Shrine of Mary, Queen of Peace, Our Lady of EDSA, stands as a powerful testament to the Philippines' fight for democracy. Inaugurated on December 7, 1989, the shrine's establishment was inspired by the historic events that unfolded along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) during the People Power Revolution in 1986. Filipino architect Francisco Mañosa designed the shrine with a unique structure featuring a striking statue of the Virgin Mary holding a rosary, symbolizing peace and the role of faith in the country's collective struggle. The shrine gained global attention when Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass here during his visit to the Philippines in 1995. Over the years, it has undergone renovations to enhance its facilities while preserving its historical significance. Every February 25, the shrine becomes a focal point for the commemoration of the People Power Revolution, drawing pilgrims, activists, and visitors alike to reflect on the triumph of democracy over tyranny. Today, the EDSA Shrine remains a revered site, embodying the resilience and spirit of the Filipino people in their pursuit of freedom.
